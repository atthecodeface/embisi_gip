<h1>GIP ALU and Shifter</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
The GIP ALU and shifter are responsible for implementing all of the
data operations of the GIP. Broadly speaking these are:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Addition and subtraction</li>
<li>AND, OR, NOT, XOR</li>
<li>Left shift by arbitrary amount</li>
<li>Logical right shift by arbitrary amount</li>
<li>Arithmetic right shift by arbitrary amount</li>
<li>Rotate by arbitrary amount</li>
<li>Two-bit step of multiply-accumulate</li>
<li>Single bit step of divide</li>
<li>XOR and zero-bit count (top down)</li>
</ol>

<p>The shifter and ALU maintain two 32-bit stores; one is an accumulator, and 
the other is a shifter result. Also five flags are maintained;
a carry flag, a zero flag, a negative flag, an overflow flag, and a shifter
flag.

</p>

<p>

The ALU and shifter register their inputs, and can store the result of the 
shifter and ALU
operation in the shifter accumulator and in the ALU accumulator.

</p>

<p>

Additional notes on flags and conditional execution:

<ol>

<li>An ALU and data shifter instruction can be conditional on the value of the
stored flags;
</li>

<li>ALU and shifter flags may optionally be set by an instruction</li>

<li>ALU and shifter flags may be sticky; that is they may be set if desired due 
to an operation, but not cleared</li>

<li>The ALU and shifter takes an operation and two 32-bit registered data items 
as its inputs.</li>

</ol>
</p>

<h2>Operands to registers</h2>

<p>The ALU contains four potential operand sources:

<ol>
<li>Input register A</li>
<li>Input register B</li>
<li>ALU accumulator ACC</li>
<li>Shifter result SHF</li>
</ol>

</p>

<h2>Operations in detail</h2>

<h2>Operation use</h2>

<p>

The use of the operations of the ALU and shifter is most importantly tied to the 
ARM instruction set. This section covers how the ALU is used
in those instructions, plus some additional information on extended instructions
for the GIP 16-bit instruction set for other operations not
supported by the ARM.

</p>

<p>A multiply instruction can be implemented with Booth's algorithm calculating 
two bits of result at a time. Say a calculation of the form
r=x*y+z needs to be performed. The basic multiply step of 2 bits can be
performed as follows:

<ol>
<li>Take the bottom two bits of multiplier</li>
<li>If there is a carry from the previous stage, add that to the bottom 2 bits
of the multiplier (held in A) (so we now have a number from 0 to 4)</li>
<li>If the number is zero then leave the accumulator alone, and clear the
carry</li>
<li>If the number is one then add the current multiplicand to the accumulator,
and clear the carry</li>
<li>If the number is two then add the current multiplicand left shifted by one
to the accumulator, and clear the carry</li>
<li>If the number is three then subtract the current multiplicand from the
accumulator, and set the carry</li>
<li>If the number is four then leave the accumulator alone, and set the
carry</li>
<li>Shift the mutliplier right by two bits (logical, not arithmetic)</li>
<li>Shift the multiplicand left by two bits</li>
</ol>

The multiplication can be terminated when the multiplier is all zero and the
carry is zero, or when the multiplicand is zero.

<br>

Initialization requires the accumulator to be set to the value 'z' and the
multiplier and multiplicand to be stored in the correct places.

</p>

<p>
A divide instruction can be implemented with the divide step instruction, one 
bit at a time. Say a calculation of the form r=x/y needs to be performed.
The basic divide step per bit can be performed as follows:

<ol>
<li>
Subtract B from ACC as the ALU result, generating the carry
</li>
<li>OR SHF with A as the logical result
</li>
<li>If B less than or equal to ACC (carry=1) then store the ALU result in ACC,
and the logical result in SHF</li>
<li>LSR B and LSR A</li>
</ol>

<br>

Initialization requires the leading zeros in the denominator (y) to be counted,
then the denominator shifted left by that and placed in B, and one shifted left
by that to be placed in A.
The accumulator should have the numerator value (x), and SHF should be zeroed.

</p>

These instructions are emulated as multi-cycle instructions.
The first operation is a conditional shift with Op1=I or Rs, Op2=Rm, and the
shifter produces a  result which is always stored in SHF and a carry that is
stored in the shifter carry. The second operation is an ALU operation with

<dd>
These instructions are emulated as multi-cycle instructions.
The first operation is a conditional MULIN with Op1=Rn or 0 and Op2=Rm. The second and further operations
are MULST, with the A input set to Rs.
If the conditional first instruction fails then the instruction terminates early.
If the ALU indicates that the termination condition is met then one more MULST operation will take
place (with register file write details), then the multiply will complete. In any case at most 16 MULSTs will be issued,
and the last will always have register file write enabled.
If the S flag is set then the final MULST will write the Z and the N flags.
<br>
Note that due to the register forwarding structure a multiply operation must block until all its component registers are present in the register file; it cannot
use the value in the accumulator for any purpose.

<h1>Data flow summary</h1>

<p>
The data flow for the ALU is from one of the registers (SHF, ACC, A input or B input) through the shifter, adder and lofical units,
through to the outputs (ALU result, passthrough result) 
and the next ACC and SHF values (and also A and B when doing multiplies and divides). This section summarizes those flows from an
analysis of the previous sections to show what sources are required for what, and when.

<p>Where A or ACC is specified the ARM emulator will indicate which, using its register scoreboarding techniques.

Note also that A must be loaded with Rs when the first MULST is presented (i.e. when the MULIN has been accepted), as the MULST
steps require Rs to be present and then rotate it; A is generally loaded on every cycle, EXCEPT those where a MULST is in the ALU stage.
