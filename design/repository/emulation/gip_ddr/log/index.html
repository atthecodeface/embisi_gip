After much struggling, we have LVDS25 outputs for the clocks.
Note that the FPGA has a bad pinout, and so has clk_0 inverted on the output buffer
The IO standard specification MUST go in the ucf file - it does not work in the source code

To do hierarchical placement by block, you must define 'model's in the .xcf file for the synthesis pass such that the models all are 'incremental_synthesis=yes'.
Each model is a verilog module name (not instance name)
Then in the .ucf file you assign area groups, and instances of the above models can be assigned to those area groups.

We started a build at 11:30
Done by 12:06

In this build we need to check the pins have the correct locations.
They do have flops in the pads for the DQ pins and A pins; there is about 3ns of routing delay to the pad from the last gate
The DQS pins have a dual flop in the pad with the same input signal for both; this seems wrong; same clock also, which may be correct. Actually the input data signals are both high. Hm. DQS low is always 0, but high toggles.
The DQM pins have flops in the pads
The DQ pads do not have any input signals attached to them though; this seems wrong also.
Look for the clocks...
int_input_drm_clock_buffered exists with its DCM and its BUFG, feeding back to the DCM. But the 90degree phase shift clock is gone.
Ah, we are using the wrong clock name in the fpga_wrapper for the inputs. That one solved.
Actually, instantiate the pads by hand - it cannot hurt.

Note that the UART has the incorrect baud rate in this run; the divider is specced for 5MHz, but it is running at 83MHz/12.
1200 baud needs a divider of 361 2/3, 2400 181, 4800 90, 9600 45. Let's put in 9600 and 2400.
We also want to check the timing between the clock domains somehow.
The timing from fetched_opcode to buffered_address in the DRAM controller is 35ns, way down on 140+.
The clock output skew on the DDR clocks is 1ns. Why?

After this build we want one that has the correct baud rate for the UART, which should then run
If this fails to run, we can go back to having an SRAM for the stack area, and have the DDR as extra memory

Tues midnight...

Build done.
We now instantiate pads, have the correct UART speed, etc.

Problems though
The dq pads have the output enable register in the IOB! Yay!
The clock-to-out times are awful.
DQS pads have HIGH as the data!
(DQS 0 has drm_next_dqs_high for O1, high for O2; DQS 1 & 3 has high for both)
CKE pins do not include the flop
DQS pads do not include the flop for tristate
DQM pins do not exist

Fixes
Controller was not driving all strobes; it is now
dqs pads should have tristate in flop; added 4 distinct net names, each with equivalent removal 'no'
dqm pads now have drivers; they have different logic, and constant drive, so no equivalent removal issue
added equivalent register removal for ddr_dram_cke<0> and ddr_dram_cke_0 (and 0/1); the latter is probably correct

Want to ensure that clk skews are okay (clk0, clk1 out)
Want to ensure that input clock delta from output clock is okay
Want to ensure DQ input pad times - these are on the P&R report
Want to ensure DQS output strobe times - these are on the P&R report
Want to ensure DQ and DQM output times - these are on the P&R report
Want to ensure A/BA/CAS/RAS/WE/SE output times - these are on the P&R report
Want to ensure logic clocks fast enough

Added 'ddr_dram_counter_is_zero' register to pipeline some of the comparisons; we were not meeting timing on pins

The clock problem we have is clk_0/1 out have a delay of 5.3ns on the clock from the GBUF, while pads have 1.9ns. Why?
Also, we need to check on the feedback output.
Well its all screwy.
Rebuild the clock scheme with a double clock to clock generate in the clock output pads. Blurgh.

Have to recheck fpga_wrapper_leds now.

(The constraints need the areas put back in (.ucf))
(The ddr_dram_as_sram.cdl needs -1 in its counter to start)

Do we need to set a fast slew rate? - we added it to the feedback clock

Build at 7:pm Weds
Constant output from the serial port.

Added back in SRAM, fixed wait to the main system (it was only asserted during ROM accesses, not the other way round).
Fixed -1 for the start counter for ddr dram controller to give cke low time.
Rebuild at 8:30pm Weds
Outputs OK> at both 1200 and 9600 baud. No input working though. Unclear if memory reads and write are working.

Fixed dram_current_access, which was tied low; should have no effect, though.

Added more debug code back in to the front of the wrapper. Now it outputs !\n and then the results of the read and write of memory
Also basically took out the DRAM from any accesses to the memory subsystem.
Build at 9:42 Weds.
Built and runs, gives the initial output, but takes no further input
Old builds do not take input either. Hm. Reboot the kitchen vaio
Aaargh, The RxD Disable Switch!

Okay, old builds work. Try the new one...
That goes now.
Rebuild with accesses to the DRAM in the memory subsystem enabled

Thursday am. Downloaded
It runs now. sram/rom is working
The DRAM reads/writes do not work.
In fact if you do an 'mr' instuction it seems to return the number of spaces in the UART FIFO, which is probably the last SRAM read or write.
Independent of address...
Maybe an unidentified latch issue?
No - the warnings are fine (did some minor tweaks, nothing functional)
But, the last data written is what we last drove out on the dram pads; it comes through the design.
So that may well be being held by the bus (or we are driving it out still)
Time to look at the simulation waveforms, and recheck the pad logic
Why would this data be on the bus? We have not done any writes.
Aaargh. DQ pins were not inverting their tristate.

Okay, so the DRAM does this:

This implies that writing to a bank is correctly writing the top 8 bits and reading it back
Reading back is also consistent; that is presumably working
Writing, though, may be dubious

It seems dqoe is going away one cycle too early. Oh, no, its not.

However, with a CAS latency of 2.5 the read data is valid some 6.75 ns after the DRAM clock edge,
which is during the clock low period (obviously).
Our input clock phase shifted by 90 degrees (3ns) is based on the feedback clock. This in turn is about 2.2ns after the internal clock,
(due to clock-to-out and pad delay); also we have pad-to-in delay, for the input clock what we are locking to, and bufg skew. (90 phase to 0 phase)
So our input clock is 5.2+ up to 1ns after our internal clock edge. Dubious to use its falling edge for clocking data we use on our clock, as it must be close to that edge.
The input data is valid 0.75ns after the clock at the DRAM, which is about 1.7ns+0.75ns after our internal clock, and is valid for 4.5ns. So we
should be clocking it any time from 2.25 after our internal clock to 6.2ns; however, there is input setup and hold time.
Most important note, though, is the data is supposed to be stable

It is probably time to use the phase shift inputs on the clocks, and stop fussing with the feedback.
To do this we just want to supply the input clocking clock at around 4ns after our internal clock; this provides 2ns for the falling edge data to propagate to internal registers, which is not enough,
but its enough for the rising edge registers we are using with CL of 2.5

We are getting the correct read data in; running the Xilinx program first gives us solid data, and we can read that reliably.
Writing is then obviously unreliable.
Hm.
When we read back the stuff from the Xilinx writes, we get (revaddr)
80000000:08000000 18000000 28000000 38000000 48000000 58000000 68000000 78000000
This is the bottom 32-bits of the second 64-bit word.

Strangely enough after our build has run we have to power cycle the board for the DRAM test to work.

Hm.
Its definitely writes that are messed up. Maybe our writes of the modes are bad too and we put it in some strange test mode?

So, time to go to a single clock for the dram side of things (get rid of the logic clock)
logic clock has a delay of 2.128ns from output clock (this might be helping some input timings? hope not)
Check the output hold time on we_n
(we_n has a clock with 1.964ns of delay from output_drm_clock)
The DCM at X0Y0 generates double_clock and output_clock, with fb from double_clock_buffered (delay of 2.402ns on the FB wire, 0.853 from DCM to GBUF, plus intrinsic)
So double_clock leads double_clock_buffered by 3.257+gbuf_int
output_clock is in phase with double_clock, so it leads double_clock_buffered by 3.257+gbuf_int
output_clock_buffered is then 0.839+gbuf_int+to_pin_delay; thus at the pad output_clock_buffered leads double_clock_buffered by 3.257+gbuf_int-gbuf_int-0.839-to_pin_delay, or 2.416-to_pin_delay
so for we_n its clock is 2.416-1.964ns ahead of double_clock_buffered at the FB pin of DCM at X0Y0, i.e. 0.452ns ahead
The clk_0 pin is registered with the double clock, but has a clock delay of 1.934ns, so is 2.402-1.934 ahead of double_clock_buffered; i.e. 0.468ns.
The clk_1 pin is registered with the double clock, but has a clock delay of 1.993ns, so is 2.402-1.993 ahead of double_clock_buffered; i.e. 0.409ns.
Now its clock-to-out is probably faster than the we_n pin, but this is clearly a low hold time output.
This actually suggests that the we_n pin for half the DRAMs is worse; this kinda fits the failure.
ras_n has a clock delay to the pin of 1.921, cas_n 1.926, s_n[1] 1.926, s_n[0] 1.964

To fix this we want to run another output clock to the outputs to give hold time, or pull the double clock in.
All we are looking to do is supply hold time for the control signals to the double clock.
So add a 90 degree phase clock to the control signals, and double register them.
Remove the logic clock as that is not helping timing analysis, and probably not the design.

Okay, had some issues with builds; had to take out the period specification for everything but the initial clock.
It has synthesised
We need to look at some timing logs to ensure that timing is met; also, we should place the SRAM at some point.
We might need to move the DRAM control logic around.
Aaaagh! cke and dqs pins share a clock! aaargh

Rebuilt with quarter clock for output; this still reads, but writes are as bad. (Friday am). No change really.
Also, we still cannot run the DRAM test after our program.  
It turns out that we are writing quite well the first word of two, but the second is being badly written.

Maybe its bounce on the dqs strobe? Try putting DCI on all the outputs; this looks right as the schematic has the
VRN/VRP resistors, and there is no local termination

Wow. That burned hot. Had to turn it off.

Took out the DCI. Nowhere near as hot.
Hm.

From this it looks like byte 3 is fine (except bit 5) in both halves of the RAM
Question is why is the second half of the RAM being written at all? Should I drive its pins? Probably. How about copying the low pins? This is DQM, DQS, and DQ.

Tried booting the new one then running the test program; no reads/writes. The test program cal'd okay.
Now do the writes above and reads

Hmm. Seems that there is something really weird going on.

Cal and plot work after this though; the hold time issue must be gone.
Maybe we are now being struck by actual read issues?

The second dram select was not asserted for the initialization; this should not help.
Try again, with SSTL2_I for the drive (half strength SSTL2) and DCI on the DQS pins only.
This should be okay for our low-speed interface

Hmm. cal does not work now. Seems that SSTL2_I does not do...
Try with SSTL2_II, and DCI on the DQS pins (hopefully get back to working reads...)

Build Friday 8pm
Download Saturday 2pm

No writes work now; reads get back the same data all the time, in pairs. Same weird thing as before.
Plot and cal work, though.

After out writes...

We do have a minor issue with the dram placement. Let's fix that, and move on to the coe and ethernet; leave the DDR for when we have the oscilloscope
Arrgh dq and dqs probably have the wrong io type - put them correct in the ucf

Now we boot...

Well, that looks like a consistent write of the top byte.
Cannot cal.
Darn.
Well that's just broken ain't it.

Upgrade to 6.0.3i

Rebuild
Turns out that there is no DCI on the DQS pins yet... the ucf overrode the verilog.

The data read actually changes between some resets.
I suspect a timing issue on the read path. Clocks not happy. Something like that.

Well, that's another whoops from Avnet.
Looking at the pins on the DDR socket it seems that clk1 is reversed.
So there will have been an issue with the banks getting different commands, and data strobes being wrong.
Does not really explain everything.
It would have meant clk 1 was inverted; still should have had hold time and setup on commands
Data was stable.
And as it happens I do not trust the mechanism I used for inverting the clock 0; probably both clocks were inverted.
It will be nice to have them the same, though.
Aaargh. Nope, clk 1 was not inverted. So probably the two clocks were different, which could have messed things up.
Rebuild with clk 0 inverted at the register to what it used to be so that its clock out is truly valid, and keeping clk1 the same as before.

Focus on the clocks, then on writes - we can read back with the ROM
Then get reads to work

So, build with the clocks 'fixed' - I am not sure about the phase, though.

Do the writes

Clock is now -0.7V to 2.7V. Hmm, a bit much, really.
However, across the resistor we do not get +ve and -ve clock; we have a difference of 2ns.
Take out the DIMM
We still have the same issue. The clock delta between +ve and -ve clock is 2ns
-ve clock leads +ve clock by 2ns, to be precise.

Add async reset for the flops - it could be a tool issue, as the synthesized logic actually looks good, but differs between the two

That did not help

We do have a long path for the phase thingy - let's add two flops on the path, and place them (int_drm_clock_phase_1_...

Trying something more dramatic.

It seems that the double_clock is actually running at 250MHz for some reason.

This is not corroborated with a toggle on the clk_n pin; with clk_n <= !clk_n, we get it low for 4ns then high for 8ns, and repeating.
So a 166MHz clock, but with +-2ns of jitter.

The problem may be the initial 125 to 83 MHz generation; this has up to 750ps of jitter on the output, and the next DLL needs at most 300ps jitter.
So the DLLs may be 'locking', but not actually locking properly from a duty-cycle perspective.
Time to move over to 125MHz on the DRAM clock. Never mind reads for now.
So, use the -ve edge of the double clock to supply 1/4 clock hold time on control signals as before.
Use the +ve edge of the double clock to generate the clock out
Use the single clock to clock the logic and register the control outputs; ensure we have less than 2ns from those registers to the IOBs for the outputs. (Place them?)
Use DDR registers on the single clock to clock the output strobes
Use SDR registers for the data and dqm pin outputs.

So, we have moved over. Also put boot rom code in a .coe file for init in a RAM
Now 2 DCMs, and the clock divider, and some initial hand placement.
Build ready at 1:35 Thursday
int_drm_clock_buffered net to divided_clock register is 1.85ns
divided_clock register out to gbuf input is 1.00ns
So, int_slow_logic is 2.85ns after int_drm_clock_buffered
Typical clock delay to central block (e.g. block RAM for boot ROM) is 1.823ns from there
We have a 5ns delay on int_drm_clock_phase_1; this is on the 250MHz clock, i.e. it has a 4ns cycle time; this is an error that needs fixing
The clock delay for that is 2.131ns
The delay to int_drm_clock_phase_2 is 2.604ns, with the clock at 2.089ns, so no issues there.
This has a 3.713ns delay to ddr_dram_clk_1_1 (clk at 2.153ns)
It has a 3.815ns delay to ddr_dram_clk_1 pad (clk at 1.993ns)
There is only 2.134 delay to ddr_dram_clk_0 pad (clk at 1.934ns)
And only 1.752ns delay to ddr_dram_clk_0_1 (clk at 2.081ns)
So we should move '2' down by about 1/6th of the distance between the clock pads, i.e. about 10% of the chip (which is 160 slices bottom to top)
And add '3' and '4', and place '3' at '1', '4' at '2', then place '1' and '2' along the way to '3' (plcae 1 at X50Y0, 2 at X20Y0)

The boot ROM is also 8 blocks, spread all over. We need to tidy that up - ah, we had not placement at all
Check ddr_hold_a_11 as the highest up placed reg - 1.902ns delay, which is not too much (quarter clock at 8ns) (this goes 33 slices up)
Check ddr_hold_ba_0 as the lowest placed reg - 1.779ns delay, which again is not too much (quarter clock at 8ns)
The inputs to the 'hold_ba_0' register itself all seem to have plenty of time on an 8ns clock

Build started at 1:55pm Thursday
Data ready at 2:40pm

Seems that int_drm_clock_phase_2 to int_drm_clock_phase_3 is a touch too long - its 4.654ns (from all_clock_periods.twr); we have 0.7ns slack in 1-to-2, and in 3-to-4, so we cal just pull the gap in a touch
We are missing the 125MHz clock on ckgen_cke_last_of_logic to drm_cke_0 (2 paths) by 3.2ns; this may be driven a lot by the ckgen_cke_last_of_logic delay of 3.2ns and 3.7ns for drm_next_cke and its fanout,
we also miss on ddr_dram_state_FFd11 to drm_hold_a_2 by 2.116ns; ddr_dram_state_FFd4 to drm_hold_a_2 by 2.016ns; the first to drm_hold_a_4 by 1.983ns
On the quarter-clock hold time things we are missing on ddr_dram_a_6 by 0.9ns, ddr_dram_a_8 by 0.8ns, a1, a_11, ba_1, s_n_1, a0, we_n; we just don't have a long time here. Can we push these to half-clock?
clock-to-out on the clock pins is about 1.85ns
clock-to-out on the control pins is about 2ns

To fix cke_last_of_logic we will duplicate the logic and push the DRAM copy much closer to its use; its input path currently has 3ns of net delay on it, with the LUT plus 0.8ns extra delay before that, so we can move it 2ns closer. (to X45)
The clock_phase issue is that 1 and 2 are swapped; we will swap them back (1 at 50, 2 at 20 is correct)
We will try pushing the control signals to half-clock; that will fix them.
For the ddr_dram_state stuff; we are kind of stuck, but we will shrink the area given to the body_main_ram and make it squarer; this will reduce wire lengths
We could move the init stuff out to a separate state machine and do a fast decode for transactions, but that is more work than I want at present.

Build started at 3:30pm Thursday
Done at 3:50pm Thursday
We are missing the 125MHz clock on ckgen_cke_last_of_logic to drm_cke_0 (2 paths) by 2.5ns; this may be driven a lot by the ckgen_cke_last_of_logic delay of 2.9ns and 3.0for drm_next_cke and its fanout
also for cke_1, by 2.2ns
We are missing the 125MHz clock on ckgen_cke_last_of_logic to hold_s_n_0 (1.763), 1.4 on we_n, ...
We meet the quarter-clock times (now half-clock times) by 1.0ns
We have a clock failure on clk_1 for the 250MHz clock now; seems that phase_4 to clk_1_1 has a net delay of 4.797ns! Probably due to shifting the bulk logic somehow. Not much slack on dram_clk_0_1 to dram_clk_0_n, either
phase_2 to phase_3 has a time of 3.7ns - okay; phase_4 to clk_0 pad is 3.0ns

Split out cke_last_of_logic with an extra pipe stage to fix its issues
Strangely enough the clk_1_1 net delay is way higher than clk_1_n delay, and they are next to each other. There are two routing systems at work here. Let's place the clk_1_1 at around Y60, and do the same for clk_0_1 at Y75

Build started at 4:26 pm
Done at 4:45pm
Now we have 5 timing errors (endpoints): drm_cke_0 (0.753), drm_cke_1 (0.553), drm_hold_s_n_0 (0.36ns), drm_hold_a_3 (0.34ns), and something with less than 0.2ns failure

Leaving the timing errors in, our clock is too strong - it is -1V to 2.7V; it is probably breaking the DRAM...
The clock is single ended; we will change to SSTL2_I_DCI, and lose the 'fast' aspects

Much better
Shall change all the control and dqm signals to SSTL2_I
Hmm. not enough swing now for the control signals - looks like they go 2.5V to 1.2V, but they need to drop below 1.13V.

Switch back to SSTL2_II
Also, rebuild with the DRAM init in a sub-FSM, to improve timings to the control signals also.

Build at 3pm Friday

Still got 4 timing failures: drm_hold_a_1 at 1.06ns, drm_hold_a_5 at 0.618ns, drm_hold_a_3 at 0.446ns, drm_hold_a7 at 0.183ns
drm_hold_a_1 was at Y40 - pull it up to Y59; drm_hold_a_3 was at Y44 - pull it up to Y59 also
drm_hold_a_5 was at Y52 - pull it up to Y61; drm_hold_a_7 was at Y52 - pull it up to Y61 also

Now timing clean (this build...)

Still no luck
It seems that the dqs pins are always high. Could it be the DCI type?

Nope.
Even tying the tristate enable low get's us nowhere.

Ah. We are only driving strobes 0 thru 3; let's do all of them

Now we do the writes, and we read back...

SystemAce build
We use a 64Mbit system ACE MPM/SC (expert mode needed), slave serial mode, 1 chain
To cfg address 0 assign led, 1 dram, 2 simple, 3 ddr
Use file dipled_2v4000.bit for chain 0, ddr_sdram_top_4000.bit for chain 1, gip_simple for chain 2, gip_ddr_v1 for chain 3
Generate the MPM file with compression
This takes 4 minutes or so
Initialize the jtag chain
right-click on the systemace, and erase; this takes 2 minutes, but ought to take longer...
assign the configuration file, and program (without erase) with verify; this may take 3 hours
Started at 2:19pm

Well, it completed at some point.

For some reason the flash download process does not work on the new build; but the original does. Hm.
Turns out that doing any write to the flash subsystem is not working.
Well, the oe_n was not correctly driven - maybe we always drove that low?

We are now ready to fix the serial port and run the ethernet

For the ethernet, I want to make the IO block execute commands when flags become set. 'become set' can come from:
1. not empty flag being set because IO writes status in to a FIFO; this needs to be able to cause the semaphore in the GIP to be set to mirror it
2. postbus reads a status from the status FIFO, but the status FIFO still has data in it; this needs to be able to cause the semaphore in the GIP to be set to mirror it
3. transmit not nearly full flag being set because IO reads data from a FIFO; this needs to be able to cause the semaphore in the GIP to be set to mirror it
4. not nearly empty flag being set because IO writes data in to a FIFO; this needs to be able to cause the semaphore in the GIP to be set to mirror it
5. postbus reads a set of data from a data FIFO; the 

Do we want auto-push of data? I don't think so; we can use a reflector-like mechanism for this in the future if we want to.
So, attach up to 8 single word postbus commands to the IO, each of which can come from a combination of FIFO flag events. Define the events. Determine when the events trigger. Handle the events once they are posted.
We should be race-clean if we assume that outbound postbus commands are the 'becomes set' variety, and postbus commands in have always cleared their virtual flags.



Note: programming the systemace takes an hour and a half
