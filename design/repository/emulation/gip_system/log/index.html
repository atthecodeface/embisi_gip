We are now ready to fix the serial port and run the ethernet

For the ethernet, I want to make the IO block execute commands when flags become set. 'become set' can come from:
1. not empty flag being set because IO writes status in to a FIFO; this needs to be able to cause the semaphore in the GIP to be set to mirror it
2. postbus reads a status from the status FIFO, but the status FIFO still has data in it; this needs to be able to cause the semaphore in the GIP to be set to mirror it
3. transmit not nearly full flag being set because IO reads data from a FIFO; this needs to be able to cause the semaphore in the GIP to be set to mirror it
4. not nearly empty flag being set because IO writes data in to a FIFO; this needs to be able to cause the semaphore in the GIP to be set to mirror it
5. postbus reads a set of data from a data FIFO; the 

Do we want auto-push of data? I don't think so; we can use a reflector-like mechanism for this in the future if we want to.
So, attach up to 8 single word postbus commands to the IO, each of which can come from a combination of FIFO flag events. Define the events. Determine when the events trigger. Handle the events once they are posted.
We should be race-clean if we assume that outbound postbus commands are the 'becomes set' variety, and postbus commands in have always cleared their virtual flags.


Note that the gip_postbus.cdl line 304 (semaphore_to_set) was commented out; probably because this does not work in the Xilinx tools
We also need to fix bit_vector to int conversions (particularly of constants!) in CDL
io_postbus_source.cdl does not accurately reflect requested_store_type in gtk

Test semaphores on receive
write ethernet receive code with polling
add event store and events in postbus event source
increase FIFO depth in postbus event commands (2, not 1)

Note: programming the systemace takes an hour and a half
